# dry-wit Smalltalk

A reimplementation of ![dry-wit](https://github.com/rydnr/dry-wit/" "dry-wit") in Pharo.

## Motivation

In my Smalltalk projects I frequently need features provided by dry-wit. I want to use them without invoking bash.

## Design

TBD

## Usage

First, load it with Metacello:

```smalltalk
Metacello new repository: 'github://rydnr/dry-wit-smalltalk:main'; baseline: #DryWit; load
```

## Work in progress

- Implement first modules.
- Provide a CLI substitute of the original dry-wit.
- Implement ext/ modules.
